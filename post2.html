I've been part of the audiophile community for a while now, but it's only recently that I discovered flathead earbuds! Unlike in-ear monitors (IEMs), which use silicone tips that go inside your ear canal, flathead earbuds rest on the outer part of your ear. This fit provides a wider soundstage compared to IEMs, offering a more open and spacious listening experience. However, they come with some trade-offs—flatheads often lack the deep bass and detail of IEMs and can be uncomfortable for some users.

Most of the flatheads I've tried required some EQ adjustments, but once tuned they mostly sound fantastic. One of their biggest advantages is their affordability; they cost next to nothing, making them an excellent entry point for anyone curious about Hi-Fi (more like "Lo-Fi") audio gear. Because of this, I've a bunch to test out so I can recommend the best options for anyone seeking a budget-friendly way to get started into audiophile equipment. :OOO


First up please take all my opinions with a grain of salt. I am no audiophile expert and everyone has differing taste in terms of how they want their gear to sound so don't take anything I say too seriously. Secondly I'll be going through each earbuds one by one so if you want the TL;DR or want to see the scores I gave for each earbud just scroll all the way down.

<span class="highlight">All earbuds were purchased from 淘宝 and tested using my Sherwood AX-3030R integrated amplifier, iPhone 12 lightning to 3.5mm DAC, and EQed using my Pioneer GR-333 graphic EQ.</span>



1.

First up is the <span class="highlight">FAAEAL Snow Lotus</span>. These came in at a price of <span class="highlight">$8 SGD</span> so they are pretty cheap. These were one of the most recommended flatheads I could find on Reddit with a lot of people telling me that they were great out of the box. Do not listen to those people. The first thing I noticed was the extremely muddy bass. This basically ruined most of it for me from the beginning and I'm big into bass. Besides that, it's similar to a lot of other flatheads where it had very high mids, but nothing too harsh that it became unbearable. After EQs these were excellent. They had good details in the bass (after I toned it down), could drive a surprising amount of sub-bass and was pretty well detailed on the high end. Overall if you are willing to EQ these I would say they are definitely worth the price.

Quality wise they are decent. They offer a fully plastic build with a pretty nice braided cable HOWEVER the cable is neither replaceable nor has any features protecting it from bends, meaning I do not expect it to last long (but its an $8 earbud so whos complaining). Overall it's what I've come to expect. No outstanding features but it's built adequately enough.

<span class="highlight">One important thing to note, the FAAEAL Snow Lotus have an impedence of 65ohms, meaning it may require more power/sound softer compared to other earbuds.</span>


<span style="color: #7c7c7c;">p.s. I will continue to update this post as I buy more earbuds</span>
